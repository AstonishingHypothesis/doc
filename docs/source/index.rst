NeuroPhi: analyze neuronal data using PyPhi (IIT)
=================================================

**NeuroPhi** is open source Python code that can be used to compute consciousness (both level/amount and contents/qualia structure) from neuronal data using `Integrated Information Theory<http://integratedinformationtheory.org/>`_

It pulls freely available neuronal data from the `DANDI database <https://dandiarchive.org/>`_
and interfaces with `PyPhi <https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi/>`_.

We will start with `NWB <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ `Neuropixels <https://www.neuropixels.org/>`_ data from the `Open Scope Project <https://alleninstitute.org/division/neural-dynamics/openscope/>`_ of the `Allen Institute <https://alleninstitute.org/>`_. Future updates will expand this approach to freely avilable EEG and fMRI data (as well as non-neural data), so stay tuned.

For added ease, everything is done inside `Google Colab <https://colab.google/>`_.
So, you can run everything in your web browser. Zero hassle.
