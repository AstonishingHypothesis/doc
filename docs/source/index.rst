NeuroPhi: analyze neuronal data using PyPhi (IIT)
=================================================

**NeuroPhi** (/lu'make/) is open source Python code that can be used to compute consciousness (both its level/amount and its contents/qualia structure) from neuronal data using `Integrated Information Theory<http://integratedinformationtheory.org/`

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
